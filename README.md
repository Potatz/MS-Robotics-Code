To download  look at the code:
  1. Download a zip here & roadrunner quickstart from https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart
  2. In Andriod Studio, open project>...>road-runner-quickstart
  3. Wait for it to run then delete the files in teamcode (in road-runner-quickstart\TeamCode\src\main\java\org\firstinspires\ftc) and replace it with the TeamCode files in the zip file from here
  4. You should be good to go! Email me if u have any issues (cstinson29@priorypanther.com)

This code isnt directly tied to the code on the laptop at school, everytime you change the code (at your house or at school) name it "backup MM/DD/YY.zip" (replacing MM with the month, DD with the day and YY with the year) and add it here
The latest code will be the backup which has the closest month day and year to the day you access this (duh) :D

Don't break anything please <3
